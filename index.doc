    <p class="para">"I am an inspiring <em><strong>software developer</strong></em> with a computer science degree. I believe that what you put in is what makes you at the end. My approach to software development has been a rollercoaster but I can say that? I finally grasp the concepts after two years of taking notes and studying JavaScript with HTML 5 and CSS 3! My approach to learning this terrific endeavor was or is waking up at 3 in the morning everyday and putting an effort to grasp the necessary syntax and elements in Web or software engineering. I for one one to become an excellent engineer and to be able to enlighten the tech field. I do hope to get ahead one day and give it my best at any obstacle in this great field. I have taken the necessary steps and are finishing my computer degree this 2022. Hope, to do good at a workplace or employer in this coming year!"</p>
